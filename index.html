            <h3>About myself:</h3>
            <p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce
                yourself
                because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see
                what
                kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and
                your
                impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>
            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to
                experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to
                listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel
                the
                music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds
                in
                the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the
                night. I
                like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I
                like
                to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like
                metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I
                like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and
                the
                nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
